# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend - Project Requirements

## 🎯 Objective
Identify and document the key features and functionalities required to build a **scalable**, **secure**, and **robust** backend for an Airbnb Clone web application.

---

## 📚 Introduction

Backend development includes server-side logic, database design, API integration, and authentication. This document outlines the **core features**, **technical specs**, and **non-functional goals** for the Airbnb Clone project.

---

## 🔑 Core Functionalities

### 1. 👤 User Management

- **User Registration:**
  - Sign up as guest or host.
  - Use secure methods like **JWT** for authentication.

- **User Login and Authentication:**
  - Login via **email & password**.
  - Optional login via **OAuth (Google, Facebook)**.

- **Profile Management:**
  - Update profile info, photos, contact details, and preferences.

---

### 2. 🏠 Property Listings Management

- **Add Listings (Hosts):**
  - Title, description, location, price, amenities, availability.

- **Edit/Delete Listings:**
  - Hosts can update or remove listings.

---

### 3. 🔍 Search and Filtering

- Search by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities (Wi-Fi, Pool, Pet-friendly, etc.)

- **Pagination** for large datasets.

---

### 4. 📅 Booking Management

- **Booking Creation:**
  - Guests book available properties for specific dates.
  - Prevent double-booking using **date validation**.

- **Booking Cancellation:**
  - Cancellation by guest/host according to policy.

- **Booking Status Tracking:**
  - Status values: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`.

---

### 5. 💳 Payment Integration

- Use secure gateways: **Stripe**, **PayPal**
- Handle:
  - Guest payments
  - Host payouts (after completion)
  - **Multi-currency support**

---

### 6. ⭐ Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can rate and review properties.
- Hosts can reply to reviews.
- **Linked to bookings** to prevent abuse.

---

### 7. 🔔 Notification System

- Email and in-app alerts for:
  - Booking confirmations
  - Cancellations
  - Payment updates

---

### 8. 🛠 Admin Dashboard

- Admins can manage:
  - Users
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Payments

---

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

### 1. 🗄 Database Management

- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**
- Core Tables:
  - Users
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

---

### 2. 🌐 API Development

- Use **RESTful APIs**
  - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE with correct status codes
- Optional: **GraphQL** for complex queries

---

### 3. 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based sessions
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Guest
  - Host
  - Admin

---

### 4. 🗂 File Storage

- Store images (e.g., property photos, profile pictures)
- Use local file storage (for now); scalable to AWS S3 / Cloudinary

---

### 5. 📨 Third-Party Services

- Email: **SendGrid**, **Mailgun**

---

### 6. 🧪 Error Handling & Logging

- Implement **global error handling** for APIs
- Centralized logging for debugging and monitoring

---

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. 📈 Scalability

- Modular architecture
- Use load balancers for **horizontal scaling**

---

### 2. 🔐 Security

- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payments)
- Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting**

---

### 3. ⚡ Performance Optimization

- Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries

---

### 4. ✅ Testing

- Unit and integration tests (e.g., `pytest`)
- Automated API testing for endpoint validation

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This document provides the foundational roadmap for building the Airbnb Clone backend. By meeting these requirements, developers will ensure the system is scalable, secure, maintainable, and ready for real-world use.
